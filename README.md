Brief Description
This page is created to showcase and exchange the use of MiniFEM and its accessories. Reporting bugs, leaving comments, and sharing cool 
application cases are warmly welcomed!

MiniFEM was originally developed to generate various stress tensor fields for my stress visualization project (3D-TSV). With sporadic efforts, 
now it has become a full-featured FEM package for elasticity simulation, and serving as a bridge among my different research-oriented projects. In short, it's not only a dataset generator but also a testbed for my elasticity simulation works.

MiniFEM is a MATLAB-only implementation, and its usage follows a command-line style. By simple running the gate-script "./MiniFEM/src/MiniFEM.m", 
one can create the FEM model via different ways. Upon this, various simulation tasks can be conducted by calling the corresponding functions in "./MiniFEM/APP/".

Being aware that MiniFEM is just a personal project, and its expected users are students who are taking FEM-related courses or researchers who 
occasionally need to use FEM for their research activities.
